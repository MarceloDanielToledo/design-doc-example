## A Great Design Document Template âš¡

A software design is a detailed roadmap that guides a team towards the success of a project. Imagine creating a new search feature in an application: without a clear design, the team could get lost in a sea of possibilities, leading to delays and unexpected results.

Design docs are collaborative documents that concisely describe how we will solve a specific problem. By aligning all team members on a common goal, they prevent misunderstandings and rework. 

## Why are design docs so important?
* Foster collaboration: As living and editable documents, design docs invite all team members to participate and contribute their ideas.
* Save time and money: They prevent unnecessary coding and reduce the risk of errors.
* Improve code quality: They allow for the creation of more robust and maintainable solutions.
* Facilitate team transitions: They serve as a guide for new members and ensure the continuity of the project.
* Reduce technical risk: They identify and mitigate risks before they become major problems.
* Encourage innovation: By documenting different alternatives, they stimulate creativity and the search for innovative solutions.

## Practical Example

Let's imagine that "x" factory is struggling with an obsolete inventory management system and contacts us to develop a solution. We're going to create a design doc using the following structure:

* **Title**
* **Authors:** Main people involved in the solution.
* **Context:** A brief high-level description of the need to be solved and the main proposed solution.
* **Goals:** Main requirements to be covered in the solution.
* **Limitations:** List of features and/or possible requirements that will not be part of the solution.
* **Main stages:** List of main stages, with dates.
* **Existing solution:** High-level description of the current system.
* **Proposed solution:** Description of the proposed solution, in this section you can include more subsections and diagrams.
* **Alternative solutions:** Description of alternative solutions.
* **Testing, Monitoring and Alerts:**
* **Impact of the solution:** Main details to consider for the new solution (costs, risks, training, etc.)
* **Open questions:** Any questions or doubts that the team has, with their respective answer if they have it in any update.
* **Scope and Schedule:** Detailed section of dates with the current status for follow-up.

> **Unlike traditional formal documentation, design docs focus on capturing the main ideas in an agile way. This facilitates the rapid understanding of requirements and allows the team to iterate on the design collaboratively.**

**Translation Notes:**
* I've tried to maintain the original meaning and tone of the text while ensuring grammatical correctness and natural-sounding English.
* Some terms might have multiple translations depending on the specific context. For example, "retrabajos" can be translated as "rework" or "redoing". I chose "rework" as it seemed to fit the context better.
* The term "design doc" is already widely used in the English-speaking software development community, so I kept it unchanged.

**Would you like me to translate any other sections or provide more specific examples?** 

**Additional suggestions:**
* **Consider using a style guide:** Adhering to a style guide like Google's or Microsoft's can help ensure consistency in your documentation.
* **Use headings and subheadings:** This will make your document easier to read and navigate.
* **Add visuals:** Diagrams and flowcharts can help to illustrate complex concepts.
* **Use a version control system:** This will allow you to track changes and collaborate with your team more effectively.
