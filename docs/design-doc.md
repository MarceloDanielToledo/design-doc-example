## Context

Currently, the product factory faces significant limitations due to its outdated stock management system. This system is not only rigid and difficult to adapt but also operates solely on an old version of Windows and does not integrate well with the factory's current processes. These deficiencies are causing inefficiencies in inventory management, such as frequent stockouts, excess inventory, and limited visibility of material flow, which negatively impacts daily operations and increases costs.

It is necessary to implement a new stock management system that addresses the current and future needs of the factory. This system must be flexible and cross-platform, accessible from any device with a web browser. It will provide real-time data, seamless integrations with other systems, and the ability to customize functions according to the specific needs of the factory, thereby facilitating better decision-making.

This system will benefit production managers, warehouse staff, and the purchasing team by providing them with a more modern and efficient tool that will support the factory's growth and evolution.

## Goals

- Improve accessibility and flexibility: Facilitate access to the system from any device with a web browser.

- Integrate with other systems: Ensure seamless synchronization with the purchasing module and other existing systems.

- Facilitate decision-making: Provide reports and predictive analytics for better planning.

- Optimize management metrics: Improve response times and operational efficiency in inventory management.

## Non-Goals

- No functionalities will be developed outside the scope of stock management.

- The system will not address the upgrade or replacement of existing hardware in the factory, focusing solely on stock management software.

- No additional features unrelated to stock management will be created, such as new functionalities for other departments or processes not defined in the scope.

- Training will be limited to basic user training for the new system; extensive training programs or support for other business processes will not be included.

## Existing Solution

The factory currently uses a stock management system developed in FoxPro. This outdated system is limited in terms of functionality and flexibility, making it difficult to adapt to the modern needs of the factory. Users interact with the system through a graphical interface that allows basic operations such as recording inventory entries and exits, generating reports, and viewing stock status.

However, the system has several deficiencies, including limited integration with other factory processes, lack of support for updates and customizations, and compatibility issues with newer operating system versions. This situation has led to inefficient inventory management and an increasing need for a more modern and adaptable solution.


## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution for the new stock management system is a web application based on Blazor WebAssembly. This choice allows for a modern and flexible platform, accessible from any device with a web browser.

### Overview

The system will be a Blazor WebAssembly application using SignalR. This enables a rich and dynamic user experience with a modern interface that facilitates real-time inventory management. The application will connect to a backend API to handle all operations related to inventory data.

### System Architecture

- **User Interface (UI)**: The web application will be developed using Blazor WebAssembly, allowing for a smooth and responsive interface. Users will be able to access the system from any device with a browser, whether on a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile phone.

- **Backend API**: The application will connect to a RESTful API that will handle all system operations, including inventory management, report generation, and synchronization with other factory modules. This API will be built with .NET, providing robustness and scalability.

- **Database**: Inventory information will be stored in a centralized database, enabling efficient queries and secure data storage. The database will be designed to easily integrate with the API and support system operations.

- **Authentication and Security**: The application will include authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify inventory data. Security measures will be implemented to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data.


### Workflow

- **Login**: Users access the system through a secure login page. Once authenticated, they are directed to the main page where they can view and manage inventory.
- **Inventory Management**: Users can record new inventory entries and exits, adjust stock levels, and generate reports. The interface will provide a clear and up-to-date view of inventory levels and alerts about potential issues.
- **Report Generation**: The system will allow the generation of detailed reports on inventory status, including movement history and trend analysis. Reports can be exported in various formats for review and analysis.
- **Synchronization with Other Systems**: The application will be integrated with other factory modules, such as the purchasing system, to ensure that inventory data is always up-to-date and synchronized.


## Alternative Solutions

### Third-Party Solution

We considered the option of acquiring a stock management system from an external provider. These solutions often offer advanced functionalities and ongoing support. Examples include systems like SAP Business One or NetSuite.

**Pros**:
